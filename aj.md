The Social and Algorithmic Fabric of Care: Addressing Bias and SDOH in Generative Models (Amanda Joseph)

Despite country specific and unique service delivery requirements, infrastructure and technological adoption, global health systems are facing the same conundrums and challenges such as the rise in non-communicable and communicable diseases, epidemics, pandemics, and environmental health risks [1,2]. Exacerbating these issues is the increasing demand placed on health systems caused by increasing burden of chronic disease among ageing populations, combined with healthcare workforce shortages [3-7]. Thus the strategic oversight of unnecessary expenditures, and targeted medical interventions are increasingly vital to maintain gold standard quality healthcare service delivery and provision, and positive population outcomes [4,7,8]. As such healthcare disparities are a complex phenomenon that can present in multifaceted ways, namely social determinants of health (SDOH), the World Health Organization (WHO) defines SDOH broadly as “the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age, and people’s access to power, money and resources” [9]. Thus SDOH may reveal why some populations could be disproportionately impacted by chronic medical conditions and lower access to care [6,10]. Thus SDOH may reveal why some populations could be disproportionately impacted by chronic medical conditions and lower access to care [6,10,11]. For example in Australia and New Zealand (Aotearoa) health disparities exist across the Torres Strait islander, Aboriginal, and Māori peoples, when compared to non-Indigenous peoples in both countries [3, 12]. Moreover, in their report the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW)  stated that the burden of disease among Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal people was 2.3 times higher than that of non-Indigenous people [13]. A further analysis by the AIHW revealed that many of the disparities impacting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people was attributed to SDOH such as housing, education, income and employment, and lack of culturally appropriate healthcare service in local languages [13]. Along a similar line in a recent report Health New Zealand detailed that inequalities between population groups exist, with Pacific, and Māori peoples having poorer healthcare outcomes when compared to non-Pacific and non-Māori people [14]. It was also revealed that there was a relationship between urbanicity, and life expectancy [14]. The report specified that life expectancy was higher in urban areas, and lower in rural and remote areas across New Zealand (Aotearoa) [12,14]. Further the demand on current health systems are anticipated to increase with aging populations, and chronic disease complexity (i.e., cancer, diabetes, neurocognitive disorders) [12,15].  
 
Thus, telehealth technologies can facilitate the delivery of health education, health information and healthcare services remotely, and hold great promise to alleviate the current and anticipated future strains on health systems [16-19]. Moreover, utilizing and expanding current telemedicine services which specifically enable healthcare providers to provide services remotely via video, telecommunications, and mobile technologies can reduce barriers to care. However, human-centered approaches to telehealth service design and facilitation are paramount, ensuring that technical products are usable, and meet end-users (e.g., healthcare providers, patients) needs [20-22]. However, negative unintended consequences and increased disparity can also be introduced with technological adoption, if they are not adequately designed, tested or implemented, with the appropriate stakeholders groups (e.g., patients, providers) [21,22]. As such clear criteria must be established through informative training, service agreements and along a similar line, digital innovation is adding pressure on governments and regulatory bodies, as diversified technologies are evolving at unprecedented paces [23-27]. Thus governments must balance the need to maintain sound governance, while avoiding regulatory capture which could stifle innovation, and limit scalability of telehealth service offerings [26,27]. Moreover the complexity of data aggregation and the synthesis of high quality data poses inherent risks when algorithms are not transparent (i.e., black box) and their data sources unclear. Thus, with the introduction of AI to generate real-world evidence (RWE) from available real-world data (RWD) the potential to advance healthcare data synthesis, interpretation and aggregation is unprecedented [28]. Thus the importance of establishing bias potential in RWD in the creation of AI models must be underscored, along with patient end-user disclosure of how their data will be used, stored to ensure that GenAI technologies don’t inadvertently negatively impact certain populations [28]. Further, Kioski and colleagues reference a study in which it was revealed that deep learning architectures trained on smartphone-based dermatological imagery can exhibit reduced diagnostic accuracy in patients with darker skin [28,29]. The data integrity discrepancy illustrates the importance of using appropriate and representative data across model training phases [28,29]. It is therefore vital that the datasets are indicative of the true population, AI modalities can truly revolutionize healthcare services, and the scalability of delivery however, the reliance on its increasing use should acknowledge that substantial bias exists and with the introduction of  automatization of this bias is increased and the risks of potential harms unquantifiable. Despite these perceived barriers to implementation and adoption, through collaboration and concentrated efforts among stakeholders, telehealth services using AI modalities hold promise to catalyze scalable healthcare service delivery gaps, and enhance the health and well-being of individuals [17, 30,31].
