Generative artificial intelligence in remote triage and patient self-diagnosis (Kleber)
Artificial intelligence (AI)–driven remote self-diagnosis tools are positioned as an entry point to health care, aiming to mitigate shortages of professionals, long waiting times, and geographic barriers, particularly in underserved and rural settings (Fan et al. 2021; Khan et al. 2025). AI chatbots and large language models (LLMs) enable patients to describe symptoms in natural language, receive preliminary diagnostic suggestions and triage advice, and obtain health education without temporal or spatial constraints, thereby functioning as a first digital contact with the health system (Fan et al. 2021; Kuroiwa et al. 2023; Xue et al. 2024).
Real‑world data from large-scale deployment of self-diagnosis chatbots show heterogeneous usage patterns across age groups and conditions, with frequent use for mild or stigmatized complaints, but also high early drop‑out rates, ludic behavior, and recurrent concerns about diagnostic accuracy and lack of actionable guidance, which threaten sustained engagement and trust (Fan et al. 2021). Experimental evaluations of LLM-based self-diagnostic support indicate inconsistencies, with better accuracy for localized orthopedic syndromes with poor performance for multifocal or complex presentations, and substantial variability across days and raters (Kuroiwa et al. 2023). Nevertheless, comparative analyses of conversational generative AI against paid orthopedic teleconsultations suggest that AI can match clinicians in logical reasoning, guidance, and overall satisfaction, and significantly surpass them in clarity and breadth of educational content, supporting its role as a scalable tool for remote counseling and patient navigation rather than a replacement for diagnostic judgment (Xue et al. 2024).
At the system level, structured frameworks for AI-enabled care delivery emphasize that remote AI-driven comprehensive community profiles must be embedded within community-tailored, hybrid models that account for digital readiness, epidemiological profiles, cultural factors, and local health priorities to avoid exacerbating inequities and algorithmic biases (Khan et al. 2025). 
In conclusion, current evidence for generative AI-based remote self-diagnosis, currently is best conceptualized as an adjunctive triage and education layer within supervised virtual care, requiring explicit design for safety netting, transparency, governance, and equity before broader clinical integration. And although a promising solution for mitigating limitations in healthcare access, could benefit from more large-scale scientific studies to evaluate its efficacy and safety.
