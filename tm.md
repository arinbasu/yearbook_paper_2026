Ethical considerations of the use of generative AI in health (Tania)
I was thinking of discussing some of the main ethical considerations with AI use in healthcare:
- Inequities and bias in AI data sets and training data, some populations not or poorly represented, or some populations do not have access - lack of co-design
- Hallucinations and automation bias, clinicians coming to rely on AI tools, not using critically, missing hallucinations, risk of deskilling
- Overhyping, lack of evidence, often evidence is poor quality - grand claims that AI performs as well as clinicians that are not backed by evidence, lack of 'silent trials'
- Trust - both in terms of lack of trust, and over-trusting. We could make this a larger part, given Prasad and Klaus both focus on trust. We could also look at how it may influence the provider-patient relationship in this regard: patient may have already consulted an AI model about their symptoms, ‘test’ the provider, if provider uses AI, responses may not be tailored to that specific patient, depending on population.  
- sustainability: requires large datacenters, impact on carbon emissions and water use. Compare to environmental impact of human labor, may replace some human labor. 
We could/should tailor this further to the specific use case of gen AI in telehealth.
