Balancing Risks and Benefits of Generative AI Use by Community Health Workers 

I. Introduction
	1.	Context: recent technological developments now enable community health workers in remote areas to have access to devices with generative AI capabilities. This opens up the opportunity for CHWs to use GenAI as they move from house to house, offering services to their communities. There is therefore a need to define the new roles and responsibilities of Community Health Workers (CHWs) in primary care and public health beyond the traditional navigator and reminder of appointments. Enabled with electronic devices with artificial intelligence built in, the new CHWs are now capable of newer tasks that are not yet formalized in the standard CHW training. There is a need to protect people and their CHWs when they begin using new technology, such as AI, in remote settings.
Objectives

Current state assessment of the capabilities of Community Health Workers

- Describe the scope of practice and typical tasks (health education, data collection, referrals)
- Measure the digital maturity of CHWs in low- and middle-resource settings
- Define Generative AI (GenAI)

Enumerate Potential Benefits of Generative AI for CHWs

- Clinical Support
-- Simplified health education materials in local languages
-- Triage guidance aligned with protocols
-- Symptom clarification and structured documentation

- Administrative Efficiency
-- Automated report creation
-- Summarization from field notes
-- Form completion and data quality assistance


- Capacity Building

-- On-demand training explanations
-- Simulation of patient counseling scenarios
-- Translation of technical guidelines into plain language

- Equity and Reach
-- Language translation for diverse communities
-- Culturally adapted messaging
-- Support for geographically isolated areas


IV. Key Risks and Concerns

1.	Clinical Safety Risks

Hallucinated or incorrect medical advice
Over-reliance and deskilling
Misalignment with national clinical guidelines

2.	Ethical and Privacy Risks
Unauthorized sharing of identifiable health data
Data retention and secondary use concerns
Informed consent limitations

3.	Bias and Equity Risks
Algorithmic bias against marginalized groups
Under-representation of local epidemiology
Language inequities

4.	Governance and Accountability Risks
Ambiguity of responsibility (CHW vs. supervisor vs. vendor)
	Lack of audit trails
Vendor lock-in and dependency

5.	Regulatory and Legal Exposure
Compliance with data protection laws
Medical liability implications
Cross-border data transfer issues

V. Risk–Benefit Framework for Decision-Making

An explicit risk-benefit framework co-designed with CHWs and their administrators can help with building awareness of the benefits and pitfalls of GenAI when used in the community setting. By jointly creating the risk registry, CHWs are more able to obtain the lens of ethical practice and apply them in their real world settings.
 
Some interventions that can be added to a pilot are identying the new tasks and classigyin them by risk levels such as

Low-risk: Converting speech to text
Moderate-risk: Summarizing patient notes
High-risk: Diagnostic or treatment recommendations

By introducing use-case classification to health workers they assimilate the risk intelligence needed to be able to independently recognize risky CHW behavior.

By ensuring that their administrators are always informed of the GenAI transactions, we are able to retain the “Human-in-the-Loop Model” and impose a mandatory supervisory review for high-risk outputs. The CHWs are then advised to follow escalation protocols in case they do not pick up the risks by themselves.

Data Governance Controls

Clear explicit de-identification requirements are co-designed with the CHWs so they can remember the spirit behind those actions. They should be allowed to play in secure sandbox environments. Administrators should be able to configure access controls and monitor the logs for non-compliance or for risky behavior..

Training and Digital Literacy

CHWs must be trained on the basics of digital health including the benefits and limits of AI. These content should be integrated into the standard  literacy modules for CHWs. The training should explicitly and clearly enumerate the do’s and dont’s of use of AI in the community. If possible, CHWs and their administrators should be able to recognize hallucination patterns.


When it comes to implementation, safeguards should be put in place such as:

Policy Framework. A formal document lists all approved and prohibited use cases. The same document can be extended to become the standard operating procedure (SOP).

Technical Safeguards. The CHWs must be given local first (or offline first) applications so they can get quality of service when they need to use the application. Clear plain language should be used when providing advice offline and all audit logs are monitored using dashboards.

Evaluation and Monitoring. A dedicated team of CHws and administrators perform continuous quality assurance by hilding regular data quality meetings, monitoring the logs and incident reported. This enables a feedback loop back to the imporevement of the system from the CHWs.

Strategic Considerations for Health Systems

With the pilot, there should be clear alignment with national digital health strategy. The pilot is not a stand alone system but integrates with existing health information systems. There should be an accompanying ferasibility and investment plan to ensure that the system receives financial support during the ramp-up period. Continuity of operations enables public trust and stronger community engagement.

Conclusion
1.	Generative AI is an important augmentation tool — but It cannot replace CHWs. TO protect both patients and the CHWs, there should be deliberate risk monitoring to prevent the harmful effects of AI (bias, hallucination, forgetfulness). In case of a pilot, a clear evaluation frameork should be co-designed with the CHWs and the data used to iterate and learn. When stable, the system can then be scaled responsibly..
